# Security Audit Exceptions

Date: 2026-05-03
Status: No active exceptions

## Policy

OpenClinXR runs `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` as part of `pnpm verify`. Production-only and dev-only checks are available through `pnpm security:audit:prod` and `pnpm security:audit:dev`.

Exceptions are allowed only when all of the following are recorded here:

- Advisory ID or GHSA.
- Affected package and dependency path.
- Why upgrade, removal, replacement, or pnpm override is not immediately feasible.
- Compensating control or blast-radius note.
- Owner.
- Review-by date.
- Planned removal condition.

Any package-manager override or pnpm audit ignore must link back to an exception entry in this file.

## Active Exceptions

None.

## Historical Exceptions
